Recruit Restaurant Visitor Forecasting 

Problem Statement:

The aim is to predict the future numbers of restaurant visitors. The data was collected from Japanese restaurants.The data comes in the shape of 8 relational files which are derived from two separate Japanese websites that collect user information: “Hot Pepper Gourmet (hpg)” and “AirREGI / Restaurant Board (air)”. The restaurants need to know how many customers to expect each day to effectively purchase ingredients and schedule staff members to mange the visitors coming in.Using the data of reservation and number of visits done by customer we need to predict the total number of visitors to a restaurant for future dates.
